## Description
This week, I am tasked with the challenge to create an App that retrieves the weather data of a selected/searched city. This dashboard will allows it's user to search a city and get the forecast the current day and of the following 5 days. The forecast data that are fetched will consist of the following; the date, the icon that indicates the day's condition, the temperature, the humidity and the wind speed.

* Enter a city name in the search input and either press the Enter key or click the search button.
* Because your searched city are saved on local storage and will display under the search button, you can click on any of the previous searched city to repeat the search again.
* By refreshing the page, the previous searched city will automatically be searched as the page loads.
* To clear the history, simply click on the "Clear History" button
